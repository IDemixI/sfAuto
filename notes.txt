Desktop Notification on new case (PoC):

Possibly store cases in an array and check against the array to see changes, as opposed to number of cases. This will eliminate the issue of creating a notification when
a case is removed from the queue. Maybe still keep the count as part of the notifcation? - i can pass arrays as parameters... remember this! Maybe we can find a way to do a compare?

"Salesforce Support Queue"
"A new case/response has been received - "case number - description"
"Total Cases in queue: 123"

document.getElementById("globalHeaderNameMink").children[1].textContent - Grab Username
I can use this if I go down the store user settings to JSON route - Can check the JSON for an entry with this name and write or update depending on what comes back. This means all "settings" including refresh rate can be stored (no need to enter it each time a user loads the page)

Below code grabs the case ref from case page - just need to check url for /5001 (for cases) and then if that's the case, add a nifty little button to fire off said code:

javascript: (function() {
    var % 20 x = window.location.pathname.substring(1, window.location.pathname.length);
    x = x.slice(0, 5) + x.slice(9);
    var % 20 refID = "ref:_" + "00D201JWt" + "._" + x + ":ref";
    var % 20 caseNum = document.getElementById("cas2_ileinner").innerText;
    var % 20 caseDesc = document.getElementById("cas14_ileinner").innerText;
    var % 20 caseContact = document.getElementById("cas10_ileinner").innerText;
    alert("Case Reference:\n\n" + refID + "\n\n" + "To Address:\n\n" + caseContact + "\n\n" + "Email Subject:\n\n" + "Case " + caseNum + ": " + caseDesc + " - " + refID)
})()
//copy(refID);

Just need to add a "copied to clipboard" message and we are gold.

<div id="sfAutoOptions" style="float: right;"><input type="button" id="toggleRefresh" src="s.gif" href="javascript:void(0)" class="btn toggle on" style="" value="⚙" title="sfAuto Options" onclick="javascript:alert('options menu')"></div>

The above needs to go under the current refresh button. I should be able to simply duplicate that element, remove the onClick, change || to ⚙, set the title to sfAuto Options and finally float right.



TODO:

	IMPORTANT:

	Desktop Notification when a new case is added to the queue - work on above code as it will currently still notifiy the user when a case is removed from the queue...
	Options menu to set interval, idle timeout & notification settings.
	
	OTHER:
	
	- Options menu to allow user to change interval, change "log-out" time, etc.
	- Open new cases in a new tab (option to set alias and only do this for your alias? Or only status new? or both!?)
	- Ability to "highlight" cases of specific type like previous todo. Choose colour, etc?
	- Move settings stuff to external JSON - PoC
